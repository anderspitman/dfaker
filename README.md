#Tidepool Dfaker 

dfaker is a fake data generator that simulates diabetes data over time. 

**Note**, this project is under active development. 

#Set up

dfaker runs with python3. In addition, using the Anaconda scientific Python distribution is recommended as the easiest way of getting all project dependencies. 
The anaconda installation for python3 can be [found here](http://continuum.io/downloads#py34).

Alternatively, installing the following packages will work as well:
* pytz
* numpy
* statsmodels

#Credits

The implementation for the blood glucose model equation was based on a mathematics paper on [blood glucose levels](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4830&context=ujmm).
