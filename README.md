#Tidepool Dfaker 

dfaker is a fake data generator that simulates blood glucose data over time. 
**Note** This project is under active development 

#Set up

dfaker runs with python3. In addition, Python Anaconda is required. 
The anaconda installation for python3 can be [found here](http://continuum.io/downloads#py34).

#Credits

The implementation for the blood sugar model equation was based on a mathematics paper on [blood glucose levels](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4830&context=ujmm).
